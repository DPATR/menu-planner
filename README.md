# Menu Planner

A simple app I'm writing to help help my wife and I plan our weekly menu. If you know how to cook, you know that it's tastier, healthier, cheaper, and more fun to eat at home. This takes the pen and paper menu planning process we use to plan our meals and turns it into a simple webapp. It uses Backbone.js + React for the frontend that communicates with a simple REST API written in rails. Planned features as I have time include real-time sync via websockets, automatic grocery list generation, and multi-user support.
